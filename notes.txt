Ideas for concepts

Something positive in the immediate surrounding (within 3 steps you can get a nice thing)
tunnel (kinda looks like this)
	g _ g
	g _ b
	g _ b
	_ x _

More good or more bad blocks in the surrounding area (surrounding 7x7 square)

Layers: ('#', 'P', 'F', 'C', 'S', 'V')

possible reasons why it's not learning:
- model is not flexible enough
- hyperparameters are bad (low learning rate, too many epochs, 
- model is not adapted to the structure of the data
- the concept is actually not encoded
	=> try a more clear concept (something immediately grabbale vs nothing there in the next 3) (done)
	
- I should not be measuring reward, but something else
- accuracy calculation goes wrong somehow
- not enough data => use more data (done)
- bad threshold (done)

I should at least be able to get my model to overfit on the training data
=> few example & high learning rate
