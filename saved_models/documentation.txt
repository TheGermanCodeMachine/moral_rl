This file contains saved models where  v2 and v3 indicate that they were trained on environment randomized_v2 or randomized_v3
[x,y] indicates the preferences between the two objectives that they were trained on

Some of these models were trained before or after the pycolab bug (standing on citizen makes the citizen disappear) was removed.

Only the models for v2 with the preferences [0.1,10], [0.3,10] and [1,10] were trained without the bug
I currently use [1,10]
